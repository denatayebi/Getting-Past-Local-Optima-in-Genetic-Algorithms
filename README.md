# Getting-Past-Local-Optima-in-Genetic-Algorithms
# $${\color{blue}IGA-WSCP:\space Improved \space Genetic\space Algorithm\space for\space solving\space Set\space Cover\space Problem}$$
The algorithm improves a genetic algorithm for the Weighted Set Cover Problem by using the **Rosenthal potential function**, which smooths the optimization landscape by penalizing uneven element coverage across sets. This enables escaping local optima and finding higher-quality solutions, especially in challenging instances.

### 4. **Multi-line Code Block Example**

If your code is more extensive, you can create multi-line code blocks the same way:

```markdown
```python
def multiply(a, b):
    result = a * b
    return result

print(multiply(2, 3))
